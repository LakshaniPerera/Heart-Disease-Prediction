# Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest Classifier
### Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early prediction is crucial for effective preventive measures. This project presents a Heart Disease Prediction Model using Random Forest Classification, leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients.

This is the [dataset](https://github.com/LakshaniPerera/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/main/Data%20Set/heart.csv) which was used in this project.
Here is the [code](https://github.com/LakshaniPerera/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/main/Note%20Books/heart_disease_prediction_random_forest_classifier%20final.ipynb).
